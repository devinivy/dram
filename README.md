Distributing record adorning MySQL


dram is a souped-up, schema-aware MySQL wrapper.  The Record class is meant to be extended for database-backed objects within your potentially kickarse web app.  Largely inspired by jQuery chaining and collections.

Big features in the works:
  - Built-in Memcached support.
  - Schema management.
